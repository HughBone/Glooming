# Scenario Gameplay
## Start:
- Make sure *scenario level* is set correctly
	- Sets the monster base statistics, trap damage, amount of gold received from money tokens, and bonus XP.
	- Based on the average level of the party and how difficult the players want the scenario to be.
- Deal two *battle goals* cards to each player, and discard one. 
- Decide on which items to equip
- Decide on ability cards to use in play (up to character max)
	- *NOTE: For first game, only use level 1 cards since they simple, then start substituting in X cards*
## Rounds:
1. **Card selection:**
	1. Select two cards (secretly!) to play face down **OR** perform a long rest
		1. If you only have one (or no) cards left, you can only do a long rest. If you can't do a long rest, you're exhausted (RIP)
	2. Of the two cards, one is selected as the *leading card* (for initiative order)
	3. Examples of appropriate communication:
		1. *“I’m attacking this guard near the middle of the round.”;*
		2. *“I’m planning on moving here and healing you pretty early in the round.”*
	4. Examples of inappropriate communication:
		1. *“You’ll need an initiative lower than 17 to go before me.”*
		2. *“I'm doing 4 points of damage to the bandit"*
2. **Determining initiative:**
	1. Players reveal their cards + ability card for each monster
	2. Initiative order goes from low -> high
3. **Characters turns:**
	1. Card actions:
		- Perform the top action of either card, and the bottom action of the other.
		- Abilities of the action must be done in the order written.
		- Free to choose **not** to do any part of the action, unless it causes a negative effect, then you have to.
		- Can ALSO use any card as an *“Attack 2”* action (top half) or *“Move 2”* action (bottom half)
		- At end of turn (not round), loot any treasure or money you're standing on
	2. The two played cards are either *discarded*, *lost*, or *activated*.
		1. Use *recover* action to return *lost* cards to hand.
		2. Some cards have *active effects* that last throughout the round
	3. Attacking:
		1. Current modifiers applied first. (e.x. active ability cards, items, etc.)
		2. Draw *attack modifier card* from deck
			1. If you have *advantage*, pick 2 and choose the better one
			2. If you have *disadvantage*, pick 2 and choose the worse one
		3. Apply monster's defensive / shield bonus
		4. *NOTE: possible for the same attack to deal different damage to each enemy*
		5. When a monster dies, place a money token on its hex. (if it was **not** summoned or spawned.)
		6. Ranged attacks get *disadvantage* if next to enemy
		7. Attacking multiple targets (see *pg. 21*)
		8. Attack effects (push, pull, etc.) (see *pg. 22*)
		9. Conditions (poison, wound, etc.) (see *pg.  22-23*)
		10. Element symbols (fire, ice, etc.):
			1. If use any part of the action, move element token to the “Strong” column of the elemental infusion table at the **end of the turn** in which the ability was used.
			2. At the end of every round, all elements will "wane", moving one step to the left in the table
			3. If there's a red X over the element, you can "use" it by moving it to the left (if not in inert column)
	4. Taking damage:
		1. Remove hit points **OR** Negate damage by choosing one card to *lose* from hand or two cards to *lose* from discard pile
	5. Long rest:
		1. Choose one discarded card to *lose*, then return the rest to your hand.
		2. Heal 2 hit points.
		3. Refreshes all spent item cards.
4. **Monster turns:**
	1. Elite monsters attack first, then normal
	2. Attack closest player in as few movements as possible
		1. *NOTE: if tie, then attack lowest initiative* 
	3. Will always do the best move it can to maximize damage / targets (e.x. avoiding ranged disadvantage)
	4. Will avoid traps unless there's no other way
5. **End of round cleanup**
	1. (optional) Short rest:
		1. Randomly put one of the discarded cards in the *lost* pile, then return all discarded cards your hand.
		2. If you want to keep the card that was randomly *lost*, suffer 1 damage and randomly lose a different discarded card. *NOTE: Can only be done once per rest.*
	2. If a *2X* or *Null* modifier was drawn, shuffle all discards back into draw deck
	3. If a monster ability card with a shuffle symbol was drawn at the start of the round, shuffle all discards back into deck.
	4. Move elemental infusions left
	5. Move round bonus cards to *lost* pile
## Types of tiles:
- Doors
	- When you move onto a closed door tile, u can open the door (i.e. the tile doesn't hinder movement)
- Traps
	- Inflicts negative effect on whoever sprung it, and then gets removed
	- Enemies will try to avoid traps, but will trigger them as a last resort
	- Flying and Jump movements don't trigger traps
- Hazardous terrain
	- Same rules as traps, but they don't get removed
	- Starting a turn on hazardous terrain does nothing
- Difficult terrain
	- Takes a two normal movement points to enter
- Obstacles
	- Cant move through them (unless using Fly or Jump)
	- Don't affect ranged attacks
- Treasure
	- See *"Loot"* on page 27 in rulebook
	- Two types of treasure tiles: *“goal”* and *"numbered"*
		- *Goal tiles* complete the scenario, and looting rules are specified by the scenario.
		- *Numbered tiles* have special rules. Looting  player should compare number of the tile with treasure index (in the back of the scenario book) to discover what was looted. See *pg. 15* for specifics
